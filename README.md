This stores all of my files for DS5030: Understanding Uncertainty
The folder, "working-files" stores base code and other files (e.g. datasets, images) needed to run the code.
The folder, "hw-delivery" stores output for homework assignments.
Other documents needed for class like the syllabus, readings, etc. are stored locally.
