# Question 1
A random sample of lunch budgets for Charlottesville adults.
```{r 1, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
budget <- c(12, 15, 20, 30, 10, 7, 10, 25, 18, 19, 28, 8)
```

## Part A
```{r 1A, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
mean_budget <- mean(budget)
print(mean_budget)
```

## Part B

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("1b.png")
```


```{r 1A_2, echo = TRUE, fig.align='center'}
variance_budget <- var(budget)
print(variance_budget)
```

## Part C
The mean should be five times the amount of the mean in Part A because we are assuming they are spending the same everyday.

## Part D
The variance should be 25 times the variance of the original sample.

## Part E
If you multiply the mean by a constant *c*, it should be the original mean times *c*.
If you multiply the variance by *c*, it should be the original variance times *c* squared.

## Part F
The mean is the original mean plus 2. This is because the number of observations are the same so the calculation is essentially the same plus whatever the constant is. 

## Part G
The variance is the same because the distance of each observation from the mean is the same.

## Part H
If you add *c* to the mean, it will be the mean plus *c*.
If you add *c* to the variance, the variance will not change. 

# Question 2

## Part A
```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("2a.png")
```

## Part B
```{r fig2b, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("2b.png")
```
## Part C
```{r fig2c, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("2c.png")
```

# Question 3

## Part A
According to https://www.statology.org/example-of-normal-distribution/, the birthweight of babies are normally distributed.

## Part B
According to https://www.statology.org/positively-skewed-distribution-examples/, individual income is right skewed. Most individuals make between $20,000 and $40,000 a year, but many make more. 

## Part C
Age of death is left skewed according to https://www.statology.org/negatively-skewed-distribution-examples/. People die when they are older. 

## Part D
I did my homework on my own.
