# Question 1

## Part A
Scatterplot of fuel efficiency (or miles per gallon) and horsepower of cars in the "mtcars" dataset. Fuel efficiency is inversely correlated with horsepower. 
```{r 1a, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data=mtcars,aes(x=hp,y=mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency and Horsepower of Select Cars",
    x = "Horsepower",
    y = "Fuel Efficency (mpg)"
  )
```
## Part B
```{r 1b, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
ggplot(data=mtcars,aes(x=hp,y=mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(
    title = "Fuel Efficiency and Horsepower of Select Cars",
    x = "Horsepower",
    y = "Fuel Efficency (mpg)"
  )
```
## Part C
```{r 1c, echo=TRUE}
mtcars <- mtcars %>% 
  mutate(hp_low_high = case_when(
    hp < 200 ~ "low",
    hp >= 200 ~ "high"))

mtcars %>% 
  select(mpg, hp, hp_low_high) 
```


  
## Part D
```{r 1d, echo=TRUE}
mtcars %>% 
  group_by(hp_low_high) %>% 
  summarize(avg_hp = mean(hp))
```


# Question 2

My dream car is a high speed train. I don't like to drive, but I like to get where I need to go quickly. I wish the United States had more high speed trains.

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("treno-francese-TVG-768x498.jpg")
